###Previous Labs (Copied from Github)

```{r}
#Data: number of ticks found on dogs sampled from a shelter
tickdata<- c(0,0,0,0,1,0,6,0,3,3,5,22,0,0,3,33,4,2,1,23,7,2,4,6,78)
hist(tickdata, breaks=90)

### Lab: Measures of Disease Frequency
![](images/samplesize.png){width=90%}
1. The sample size necessary to detect disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer at 95% confidence is 59 deer.

2. Hypergeometric distribution
a) The sample size required to detect disease at 1% prevalence in a large population at 95% confidence is around 300
b) The sample size required to detect disease at 2% prevalence in a large population at 99% confidence is around 230
Situation B, despite being measured at a higher confidence, requires a lower sample size than situation A. This is because in a large populations size, the difference between 1% and 2% can be significant.

3. 300 deer sampled out of a population of 4000 tested negative for antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, we can be 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD is less than 1%.

4. 'Lame Disease' in wild turkeys 
a) Lee County prevalence and confidence intervals (Sterne)
Prevalence is 0.200
Lower Confidence Level is 0.143
Upper Confidence Level is 0.273

Chambers County prevalence and confidence intervals (Sterne)
Prevalence is 0.267
Lower Confidence Level is 0.131
Upper Confidence Level is 0.449

Russell County prevalence and confidence intervals (Sterne)
Prevalence is 0.031
Lower Confidence Level is 0.009
Upper Confidence Level 0.087

b) The prevalence of all three counties using the Fisher method is as follows:
Lee
N=150
Infected=30
Non-infected=120
Prevalence%=26.7%
Chambers
N=30
Infected=8
Non-infected=22
Prevalence%=20.0%
Russell
N=96
Infected=3
Non-infected=93
Prevalence%=3.1%

###SIR Models

```{r}
library(deSolve)
## Create an SIR function
sir <- function(time, y, parameters) {   #time, state , parameters
  
  with(as.list(c(y, parameters)), {
    
    dS <- -beta * S * I
    dI <-  beta * S * I - gamma * I
    dR <-                 gamma * I
    dN <- dS + dI + dR
    
    return(list(c(dS, dI, dR, dN)))
  })
}

### Set parameters
## Proportion in each compartment: Susceptible 0.999999, Infected 0.000001, Recovered 0
#init       <- c(S = 1-1e-6, I = 1e-6, R = 0.0)
init <- c(S = 0.99, I = 0.01, R = 0, N = 1)
## beta: infection parameter; gamma: recovery parameter
#parameters <- c(beta = 1.4247, gamma = 0.14286)b=.0952381 g = 0.04761905
parameters <- c(beta = 1, gamma = 1) #gamma=0.1
## Time frame
times      <- seq(0, 300, by = 1)

## Solve using ode (General Solver for Ordinary Differential Equations)
out <- ode(y = init, times = times, func = sir, parms = parameters)
## change to data frame
out <- as.data.frame(out)
## Delete time variable
out$time <- NULL
## Show data
head(out, 10)

## Plot
matplot(x = times, y = out, type = "l",
        xlab = "Time", ylab = "Proportion", main = "SIR Model",
        lwd = 1, lty = 1, bty = "l", col = 1:4)

## Add legend
legend(240, 0.7, c("Susceptible", "Infected", "Recovered", "Total"), pch = 1, col = 1:4, bty = "n")
```

###Frog Bullying Disease

Gamma = 1/21 = 0.048
If R0 = 2, then Beta = 2*0.048 = 0.096

```{r}
library(deSolve)
## Create an SIR function
sir <- function(time, y, parameters) {   #time, state , parameters
  
  with(as.list(c(y, parameters)), {
    
    dS <- -beta * S * I
    dI <-  beta * S * I - gamma * I
    dR <-                 gamma * I
    dN <- dS + dI + dR
    
    return(list(c(dS, dI, dR, dN)))
  })
}

### Set parameters

        xlab = "Time", ylab = "Proportion", main = "SIR Model",
        lwd = 1, lty = 1, bty = "l", col = 1:4)

## Add legend
legend(240, 0.7, c("Susceptible", "Infected", "Recovered", "Total"), pch = 1, col = 1:4, bty = "n")
```
This model shows that at around time = 100, the disease is at it's peak with the highest number of infected individuals. This is also the approximate time that the number of susceptibles and the number of recovered are equal. After this, the disease begins to infect fewer and fewer as time passes, and the number of recovered individuals increases.
